    "paths"
    -------

[paths]
default = https://WilbertMS@bitbucket.org/WilbertMS/colegio

    Assigns symbolic names and behavior to repositories.

    Options are symbolic names defining the URL or directory that is the
    location of the repository. Example:

      [paths]
      my_server = https://WilbertMS@bitbucket.org/WilbertMS/colegio
      local_path = /home/me/repo

    These symbolic names can be used from the command line. To pull from
    "my_server": 'hg pull my_server'. To push to "local_path": 'hg push
    local_path'.

    Options containing colons (":") denote sub-options that can influence
    behavior for that specific path. Example:

      [paths]
      my_server:hg push https://WilbertMS@bitbucket.org/WilbertMS/colegio
      my_server:pushurl = ssh://example.com/my_path

    The following sub-options can be defined:

    "pushurl"
       The URL to use for push operations. If not defined, the location
       defined by the path's main entry is used.

    "pushrev"
       A revset defining which revisions to push by default.

       When 'hg push' is executed without a "-r" argument, the revset defined
       by this sub-option is evaluated to determine what to push.

       For example, a value of "." will push the working directory's revision
       by default.

       Revsets specifying bookmarks will not result in the bookmark being
       pushed.

    The following special named paths exist:

    "default"
       The URL or directory to use when no source or remote is specified.

       'hg clone' will automatically define this path to the location the
       repository was cloned from.

    "default-push"
       (deprecated) The URL or directory for the default 'hg push' location.
       "default:pushurl"
